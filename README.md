# sinker

Self-hosted video subscription and archive manager

## Local development

Sinker is a [Next.js application](https://nextjs.org/) that uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) by default.

To run a local dev server that watches for file changes:

- Run

  ```sh
  pnpm nx serve sinker
  ```

- After the server has started, navigate to http://localhost:24242/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace
